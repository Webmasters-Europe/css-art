# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/Webmasters-Europe/css-art).

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Get Started

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone _your forked repository_ to your computer:

3. Before you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Webmasters-Europe/css-art
    git pull upstream master
    ```

    If you run into a merge conflict, you have to resolve the conflict.

4. Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` (write a meaningful commit message, if possible):

5) Push your changes _to your repository_:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

6) Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and make a pull request:

7) Wait until one of the maintainers merges your pull request. If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.

## Pull Requests

-   **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests. When you don't know how to write tests you can ask for help in your PR.

-   **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

-   **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

    -   feature prefix with feature/
    -   bugfix prefix with bugfix/
    -   hotfix prefix with hotfix/

-   **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

-   **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting them.

## How can I contribute to projects?

-   **1.** **Issue :** Start with testing the code for any bugs. If found raise an issue about it.

Before filing an issue:

-   Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
-   Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
-   Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
-   Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

**2.** **Suggest features:**

Before submitting a pull request:

-   Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
-   Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.

**3.** You can also help in providing proper documentation of the various projects.

## Etiquette & Code of Conduct

Use this project as a playground. We don't care if you break things. Use this project as a ground where you can practice and experiment.

This project is open-source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code held within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers.
Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the world that developers are civilized and selfless people. That means **don't spam**.

Respect the maintainer's decision and not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.

**Happy coding**!
